This little program is meant to be run right in your terminal. It converts any text you enter into the prompt into ASCII art.

To get started, navigate to "ascii-art-converter" in your terminal.

Once you're there, type the following command:
  Windows: "python main.py"
  MacOS: "python3 main.py"

Enter whatever text you want and watch the magic happen!
