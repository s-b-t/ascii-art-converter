This little program is meant to be run right in your terminal. It converts any text you enter into the prompt into ASCII art. \n

To get started, navigate to ```ascii-art-converter``` in your terminal.

Once you're there, type the following command: \n
  Windows: ```python main.py```
  MacOS: ```python3 main.py``` \n

Enter whatever text you want and watch the magic happen!
